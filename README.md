# DISCHAT

### V 1.0

### Description
A simple chatting program is hidden as a chrome extension

Why? -> im a bored 13-year-old who wants to talk to my friends at school

Ok, I know it looks like crap but still functionality > looks, in this case, ok, ok.

oh, also first extension ;)

## Basic Usage and Installation

Download the extention from chrome webstore -> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dischat/kclncjiadoodgcfnfpnkcnibkdpehgah

after that click the icon and put the ip the chat room number you want
for the ip you can use the public one -> 35.227.64.163:8000 or a custom one

## Hosting a server

To host a server you need python (for now) to install go to www.python.org/downloads/ and download and install

download the Server.py and open it in a text editor (if you double click on it it will run the program so right-click -> open with -> notepad [if you're on windows])

once you open Server.py in a text editor scroll all the way down to the lane that has "------change port and IP to preferred settings-------" 
to the left of that, there is a number and text that says 'localhost' change 'localhost' to a LAN IP (if don't know how to get an address go to [short tutorial](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/article.aspx?articleid=14842&printable=y)) remember to keep the (') its very important
and for the number it doesn't matter just make sure it's above like 4000 and bellow 9999 then your all good

oh, and keep the IP address and the port number you will need it to join the server

after all that run the Server.py file, a window will popup that is just a console log for the server (if icon not there clikc the puzzle piece and click the pin icon left of the extention)

## Joining Custom Server

easy just get the ip address and port from when you or your friend hosted a server put it in the ip address bar as "[ip]:[port]" so ex. "127.0.0.1:8080"
and for the chatroom num put that as any single digit num and make sure your friend puts the same one in
